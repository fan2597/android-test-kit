**UPDATE (Dec 19, 2014)**
Since it's initial release in 2013, Espresso has been adopted by hundreds of projects. With the latest 2.0 release, Espresso is now part of the Android Support Repository. We are currently in the process of migrating documentation to developer.android.com. This site will serve as a temp hub for Espresso 2.0 documentation and later remain up for historical purposes. We still provide the Espresso 1.1 static JARs in the bin folder. The source code hosted under the "Source" tab is still Espresso 1.1 and will be replaced as soon as we launch in AOSP!

We do this by using the power of the cloud and by providing Google developers with great tools: fast emulators and nifty test frameworks.<br>
